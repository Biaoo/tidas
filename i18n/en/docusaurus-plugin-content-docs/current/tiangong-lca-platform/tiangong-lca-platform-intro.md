# Introduction to TianGong LCA Platform

**Industrial implementation of TIDAS architecture - [TianGong LCA Platform](https://docs.tiangong.earth/)**

As the first open-source implementation of TIDAS (TIangong DAta System) architecture, the [TianGong LCA Platform](https://docs.tiangong.earth/) provides a full-process LCA solution compliant with international standards.

## Platform Architecture

- **Architecture Completeness**: 100% implementation of TIDAS data architecture and API specifications.

- **Hybrid Deployment Capability**: Supports cloud SaaS services and enterprise-level on-premise deployment.

- **Distributed Collaboration**: Cross-organization project management system based on RBAC permission model.

- **Ecosystem Hub**: Aggregates 70+ industry TIDAS standard datasets globally.

## Key Benefits

- **Standard Format Assurance**: Standardized data model based on TIDAS architecture with built-in format validation ensures user-entered data complies with structural, type, and reference relationship requirements, preventing human errors without needing to understand underlying format definitions.

- **Integrated Tool Modules**: The platform incorporates the complete [TIDAS Tool System](tool/tidas-tool-intro.md), covering key capabilities like data format validation, format conversion (TIDAS â†” eILCD), and data import/export. Users can focus on professional content while ensuring data flow continuity and operational efficiency.

- **Large-scale Collaboration Support**: Supports parallel collaboration among multiple users, teams, and roles. The platform has been successfully applied in multiple projects, validating its stability and manageability in complex scenarios like high concurrency and multi-permission management.

- **Simple, Intuitive Operation**: Build system models through graphical interface with simple operations, allowing users to focus on industry-specific technical content.

- **Flexible Configuration & Security**: Supports private deployment, permission configuration, and adapts to different users' data security requirements.
