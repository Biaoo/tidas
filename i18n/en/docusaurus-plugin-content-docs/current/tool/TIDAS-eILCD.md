# TIDAS and eILCD Data Format Conversion

TIDAS and eILCD are two different Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) data formats. TIDAS is an open standard based on JSON Schema, while eILCD is an XML-based standard. To enable data interoperability between these formats, we provide a conversion tool that can convert TIDAS format data to eILCD format and vice versa.

<!-- Provide some examples? Such as what happens after running the tool -->

## 1. TIDAS to eILCD

## 2. eILCD to TIDAS

## 3. eILCD Format Validation
