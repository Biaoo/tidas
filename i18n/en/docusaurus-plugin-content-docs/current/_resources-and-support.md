# Concepts and Methodologies

The development of the TIDAS system follows the basic principles and framework of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The following content will help you understand the basic concepts of LCA, core principles of dataset construction, dataset composition, and other essential information.

## [LCA/Carbon Footprint Database Construction Guidelines](https://www.carbonfootprint.network/docs/category/lca-database-guideline)

These guidelines include basic concepts of Life Cycle Assessment/Carbon Footprint data (hereinafter referred to as LCA data), core principles of dataset construction, dataset composition, as well as specifications for data collection, documentation, and data quality assessment. They are used to guide dataset developers in constructing LCA datasets that meet high-quality, internationally recognized requirements.

### ISO Standards

**[ISO 14040/14044](https://www.iso.org/home.html)**: Principles and framework for Life Cycle Assessment, including the purpose, scope, data quality, and interpretation of LCA.

**[ISO 14067](https://www.iso.org/home.html)**: International standard for carbon footprint calculation, including basic principles, scope, data quality, and interpretation of carbon footprint accounting.

### GHG Protocol

**[Greenhouse Gas Protocol](https://ghgprotocol.org/standards-guidance)**: A widely used global standard for greenhouse gas accounting and reporting, providing a framework and methodology for businesses, governments, and other organizations to measure and manage greenhouse gas emissions.

### EPD and ILCD Guidelines

**[Environmental Product Declaration (EPD)](https://www.environdec.com/home)**: A standardized environmental information report that demonstrates a product's environmental impact throughout its life cycle.

**[ILCD Handbook](https://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ilcd.html)**: A standardized guideline developed by the European Commission, providing a unified data format and methodological framework for life cycle assessment.
