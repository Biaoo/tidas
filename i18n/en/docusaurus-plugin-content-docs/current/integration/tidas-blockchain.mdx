# TIDAS Data Security Mechanism

## Background and Challenges

Carbon footprint data faces multiple authenticity challenges during application:

- Data can be easily tampered with, leading to information distortion
- Difficulty in tracing change history
- High cost of traditional verification methods
- Lack of common trust foundation in multi-party collaboration

These challenges not only affect data value but may also lead to compliance risks and trust crises.

## Blockchain-Based Data Tamper-Proof Mechanism

Blockchain, with its core features, provides an ideal solution for data tamper-proofing:

- **Immutability**: Chain structure combined with cryptography ensures data is difficult to alter once recorded
- **Distributed Architecture**: Eliminates single-point tampering risks
- **Timestamp Mechanism**: Provides indisputable chronological proof
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Ensures consistent recognition of data status among network participants

## TIDAS Working Mechanism

TIDAS builds an efficient data trust mechanism based on the Tiangong data platform and blockchain technology:

### Process Design

1. **Data Submission and Review**
   - Contributors submit original data to the Tiangong platform
   - Platform review ensures data complies with TIDAS standards

2. **Hash On-Chain**
   - Calculate hash values of processed data
   - Write hashes to blockchain and obtain transaction credentials
   - Associate stored data content with transaction hashes

3. **Verification Mechanism**
   - Users obtain data and transaction hashes
   - Recalculate hash values of obtained data
   - Compare with blockchain records to verify integrity

### Technical Features

- **Lightweight Design**: Only hashes on-chain, balancing performance and cost
- **Dual Protection**: Combines platform management with blockchain tamper-proofing
- **Privacy Protection**: Original data not directly exposed
- **Open Verification**: Supports independent third-party verification

## Practical Application

We have collaborated with Ant Chain to develop a blockchain-based trusted solution for carbon footprint data, providing strong guarantees for the authenticity of carbon footprint data.
