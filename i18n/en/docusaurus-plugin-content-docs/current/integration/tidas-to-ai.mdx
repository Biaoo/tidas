# MCP AI Services

MCP AI Services are the AI-powered intelligent engine components in the TIDAS system, designed to enhance lifecycle data understanding, completion, and validation capabilities, adapting to next-generation environmental data management and intelligent application scenarios.

## âœ¨ Core Features

MCP (Multi-channel Cognitive Processor) integrates AI capabilities into the TIDAS lifecycle database, providing the following core services:

- **Semantic Search**: Query lifecycle inventory (LCA Flows) data using natural language
- **Intelligent Completion**: Assist in filling missing fields or suggesting structural improvements
- **Format Validation**: Automatically validate data compliance based on JSON Schema
- **Human-Machine Interface**: Visual operation and debugging through MCP Inspector (see image below)

## ðŸ§± Technical Implementation

MCP services are implemented through:

- Transmission Protocols: Supports SSE, WebSocket, HTTP and other modes
- Data Processing: Parsing based on TIDAS data format (JSON Schema)
- Tool Scheduling: Integrates various intelligent tools like `Search_flows_Tool`
- Local Deployment: Supports private local deployment to ensure data security

## ðŸ”— Open Source Link

MCP services are open source on GitHub:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/linancn/tiangong-lca-mcp](https://github.com/linancn/tiangong-lca-mcp)

The project provides complete server source code, Inspector frontend, tool registration and testing documentation for quickly building AI-driven LCA intelligent platforms.

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

- TIDAS database must be built with structure compliant to [TIDAS Schema](/docs/category/tidas-schema)
- Configure MCP Bearer Token and transmission address
- Register required tools as needed (e.g. Search_flows_Tool)

If you want to further integrate LCA intelligent services or build your own AI data platform, MCP will be an efficient starting point.
