# MCP AI Services

MCP (Model Context Protocol) AI Services are intelligent engine components in the TIDAS system that enhance lifecycle data understanding, completion, and validation capabilities, designed for next-generation environmental data management and intelligent application scenarios.

## âœ¨ Core Features

MCP services integrate AI capabilities into TIDAS lifecycle databases, providing the following core features:

- **Semantic Search**: Query lifecycle inventory (LCA Flows) data using natural language
- **Intelligent Completion**: Assist in completing missing fields or suggesting structural improvements
- **Format Validation**: Automatically validate data compliance based on JSON Schema
- **Debugging & Validation Support**: Supports debugging and validating service processes using the MCP Inspector tool (as shown below)

> ðŸ“· Illustration: We use the MCP Inspector tool to debug queries for "Cypermethrin" related flow information, verifying that the MCP service successfully returns structured data.

## ðŸ§± Technical Implementation

MCP services are implemented based on:

- **Transport Protocol**: Supports SSE service with WebSocket, HTTP and other transmission modes
- **Data Processing**: Parses and processes data based on TIDAS format (JSON Schema)
- **Tool Scheduling**: Integrates various intelligent tools like `Search_flows_Tool`
- **Local Deployment**: Supports private deployment to ensure data security and compliance

## ðŸ”— Open Source Link

MCP services are open-sourced on GitHub:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/linancn/tiangong-lca-mcp](https://github.com/linancn/tiangong-lca-mcp)

The project provides complete server code, sample frontend (including integration examples for the Inspector debugging tool), tool registration and testing documentation, enabling rapid development of AI-driven lifecycle data platforms based on TIDAS architecture.

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

- A lifecycle database compliant with [TIDAS Schema](/docs/category/tidas-schema) has been built
- MCP Bearer Token and service address have been configured
- Required intelligent tools (e.g. Search_flows_Tool) have been registered as needed

If you wish to further integrate LCA intelligent services or build your own AI data platform, MCP services provide an efficient starting point.
