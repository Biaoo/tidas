# Introduction

TIDAS (TianGong LCA Data System) is an open-source JSON-based data structure system that provides standardized, extensible data management solutions.

TIDAS simplifies lifecycle data management processes:

  **Methodology Layer**: Lifecycle data management follows the [LCA/Carbon Footprint Database Construction Guidelines](https://www.carbonfootprint.network/docs/category/lca-database-guideline), fully compatible with [ISO 14040/44](https://www.iso.org/home.html), [ILCD Handbook](https://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ilcd.html) and [ecoinvent](https://www.ecoinvent.org/) standards.

  **Data Layer**: TIDAS adopts a unified data format based on JSON structure and JSON Schema validation, with high scalability and compatibility to support future domain-wide technical architectures (blockchain, data spaces, AI).

  **Conversion Layer**: TIDAS and eILCD have multi-language bidirectional lossless mapping services, enabling lossless data format conversion and interoperability with mainstream formats like eILCD, making data exchange between different systems simple and efficient.

  **Platform Layer**: [TianGong LCA Platform](https://docs.tiangong.earth/) can meet LCA data development and publishing needs, supporting both open platform and private deployment modes to satisfy different organizations' application requirements.

The TianGong LCA platform will provide comprehensive support for your LCA data management and environmental impact assessment, helping you achieve more accurate results in sustainability research.

## TIDAS Framework

The TIDAS framework is an open-source JSON-based data structure system that provides standardized, extensible data management solutions. The TIDAS framework includes the following core components:

  - **`TIDAS-schemas`**: JSON-based schema validation ensuring data structure standardization.

  - **`tiangong-tool`**: Integrated tools for data import, export, validation, and publishing, supporting data platform module development.

  - **`TIDAS-EF`**: Provides standardized lifecycle data initialization packages, including unit processes, elementary flows, flow properties, LCIA method files, etc., ensuring data consistency.

  - **`TIDAS-convert`**: Multi-language bidirectional lossless mapping services with eILCD and other mainstream formats, enabling lossless data format conversion for efficient data exchange between different systems.

  - **`tiangong-lca-next-docs`**: Provides complete data management solutions for rapid data platform construction, supporting private deployment.

  - **[TianGong LCA Platform](https://docs.tiangong.earth/)**: Free and open LCA data management platform with data creation, editing, validation, and publishing features, ready to use upon registration.
