# What is TIDAS

TIDAS (**TI**angong **DA**ta **S**ystem) is an open-source JSON-based data system that provides standardized, extensible data management solutions.

TIDAS simplifies lifecycle data management processes:

  **Methodology Layer**: Lifecycle data management follows the [LCA/Carbon Footprint Database Construction Guidelines](https://www.carbonfootprint.net/docs/category/lca-database-guideline), fully compatible with [ISO 14040/44](https://www.iso.org/home.html), [ILCD Handbook](https://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ilcd.html) and standards like [ecoinvent](https://www.ecoinvent.org/).

  **Data Layer**: TIDAS adopts a unified data format based on JSON structure and JSON Schema validation, offering high extensibility and compatibility to support future technologies (blockchain, data spaces, AI).

  **Conversion Layer**: TIDAS and eILCD provide multilingual bidirectional lossless mapping services, enabling seamless data format conversion and interoperability with mainstream formats like eILCD, simplifying data exchange between different systems.

  **Platform Layer**: [TianGong LCA Platform](https://docs.tiangong.earth/) fulfills LCA data development and publishing needs, supporting both open platform and private deployment modes to meet different organizational requirements.

## TIDAS Framework

The TIDAS framework is an open-source JSON-based data structure system that provides standardized, extensible data management solutions. The TIDAS framework includes these core components:

  - **`TIDAS-schemas`**: JSON-based schema validation ensuring data structure standardization.

  - **`TIDAS-tool`**: Integrated tools for data export, validation, publishing, supporting data platform module development.

  - **`tiangong-lca-next-doc`**: Complete data management solution for rapid platform development, supporting private deployment.

  - **[TianGong LCA Platform](https://docs.tiangong.earth/)**: Free open LCA data management platform with data creation, editing, validation, and publishing capabilities - ready to use upon registration.
