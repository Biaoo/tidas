TIDAS Schema is a JSON Schema-based Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) data specification framework designed to standardize LCA data and ensure interoperability. By defining strict data structures and validation rules, it guarantees data exchange quality between different systems and effectively unifies LCA data formats.

The automated validation mechanism ensures data integrity, enables seamless data exchange between different LCA tools, and features modular design to support business expansion needs.

## Technical Features

- Based on JSON Schema specification
- Modular architecture design
- Supports multi-language validation
- Provides detailed error diagnostic information

TIDAS Schema includes 17 files. For specific content, see [Data Structure (JSON Schema)](/docs/schema/json-schema)
