# Account Profile

The **Account Profile page** is divided into three sections: **Basic Information**, **Change Password**, and **Change Email**.

## Basic Information

Here, you can view your current email, role, and nickname. You can also edit your nickname, and any changes will instantly update the display in the upper-right corner, replacing the default email (your registered one).

## Change Password

The system keeps your initial password on file. To change it, simply enter your new password and confirm it.

## Change Email

In this section, your current registered email will be displayed. Just enter your new email address and confirm it to complete the change.
